# Import Orders

Angular app for order processing.

Front-end prototype, not intended for any practical use.

Based on Angular Material components, including MatDialog, MatStepper, MatTable, MatSort, MatPaginator.

Also features global loading spinner attached as Http Interceptor.

MobX state management store is set up, but basically utilized for getter caching rather than state storage.

Back-end mock is based on Angular in-memory-web-api hacked to support pagination, filtering, and ordering in through query parameters.
